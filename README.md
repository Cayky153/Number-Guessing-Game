# About

This is a simple number guessing game built with CLI(Command line interface), where the computer randomly selects a number and the user has to guess, with a limited amount of chances based on the difficulty he has chosen(Easy, Medium and hard). This project was made with the intention of studying and practicing CLI abilities.
